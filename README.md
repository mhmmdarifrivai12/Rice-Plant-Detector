# Ripad - Rice Plant Detector (Final Capstone Project 2024)
RIPAD is an innovative application designed to address the critical challenges faced by rice farmers in Indonesia regarding the identification and management of rice crop diseases. With rice farming being a vital sector for the country's economy and food security, the prevalence of diseases such as blast and leaf blight poses significant threats, often leading to substantial yield losses. RIPAD utilizes advanced machine learning technology to enable farmers to detect rice diseases through simple photos uploaded via their mobile devices. The application harnesses the power of cloud computing to provide rapid, precise analyses of the uploaded images, offering actionable recommendations for disease management. Through accessible technology, RIPAD aims to revolutionize how farmers manage crop health, ultimately contributing to a more resilient agricultural future.
